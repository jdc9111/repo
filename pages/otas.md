## OTAS #ornge
### OTAS 1 **Emergent 1 (<4 hours)**
#### Conditions that are threats to life or limb (or imminent risk of deterioration) requiring immediate aggressive interventions that cannot beyond the scope at the sending hospital or nursing station or patients are requiring immediate intervention at the receiving facility
##### Scene Response or Modified Scene
##### Declared Life or Limb
##### Acute STEMI that requires time sensitive or rescue intervention i.e. not reperfused by TNK
##### Acute multisystem trauma
##### Acute vascular emergency requiring immediate surgical intervention type A dissection, AAA
##### Complicated Labour (preterm,breach, abruption\
##### intracranial hemorrhage requiring neurosurgical intervention
##### Orthopaedic injury with neurovascular compromise 
                - Pre-term labour in a facility without resources to manage the neonate
        - **Emergent 2 (<6 hours)**
            - Conditions that are a potential threat to life, limb or function requiring rapid medical interventions. These patients have an acute illness or injury and have the potential for further deterioration. They need prompt treatment to stabilise developing problems and treat severe conditions. These may be patients with relatively stable conditions that overwhelm a local hospital/nursing statopms ability to care for them.
                - Intubated patient in setting without a ventilator
                - ACS or NSEMI with ongoing CP
                - Septic patient with early end organ failure in rural hospital requiring tertiary level care
        - **Urgent 3 (<12 hours)**
            - Patient conditions that could potentially progress to a serious problem requiring emergency intervention. These patients are stable, but their diagnosis or presenting problem suggests a potentially more serious process. These may be patients that are undifferentiated without a precise diagnosis but are stable currently but there is a concern for possible deterioration beyond the capabilities of the sending facility.
                - Stable NSTEMI without chest pain
                - Ventilated/septic patient in community hospital requiring tertiary level care
                - SOB patient with stable vital signs going to rule out PE
        - **Non-Urgent 4**
            - closed #
            - stable abdominal pain going for assessment with low risk or surgical cause
            - Repat from ICU to open a bed for future acutely ill patient
        - **Non-Urgent 5**
            - Next day NU/scheduled calls
            - Repat patients who are not holding a ICU bed
